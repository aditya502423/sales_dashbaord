It provides insights into sales before and after promotions, evaluates the performance of different promotion types (e.g., BOGOF, Cashback, % Off), and highlights store- and product-level performance using interactive visuals.

Purpose of the Dashboard

1.Measure the effectiveness of sales promotions by comparing sales before and after promotion.
2.Identify top- and bottom-performing stores based on unit sales and revenue.
3.Track which promotional types (e.g., BOGOF, Cashback) drive the highest sales and volume.
4.Analyze product category performance post-promotion to understand consumer preferences.
5.Assist retail and marketing teams in making data-driven decisions to optimize inventory, improve promotions, and maximize ROI.
